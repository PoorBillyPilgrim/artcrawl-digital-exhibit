    "Title of Artwork": "For I Am A Cage In Search Of A Bird",
    "Artist Statement": "After being forced into isolation over the past year, we all know how easy it is to sit idly by and watch the days blur together. As a result, we have become increasingly divorced from ourselves, reaching for unattainable ideals while at the same time ostracizing our flaws. This piece grapples with the idea of accepting ourselves as we are and attempting to reconnect with every facet of ourselves, because we are all still healing.",

    "Title of Artwork": "Character leitmotif - A mystery the library cannot answer",
    "Artist Statement": "The silence of my apartment led to a lot of late-night sessions at the piano, which started to speak to me more and more. Some of the songs that emerged were inspired by stories and characters I and my friends invented together over Zoom to keep our social lives alive during the pandemic. This one was for a realistically studious character who poured himself into his books but who really wanted to know more about his absent family. His theme, though simple, felt relevant. It's one of my favorites.",

    "Title of Artwork": "The Language of Connection",
    "Artist Statement": "To me, connection is best entailed by the universal language that represents us all: music. In this piece, I used the timeless art of film photography to capture a modest yet joyous street performer, showing how accessible the language of music is to us all. Though the power of digital media allows us to always be connected through music, I can't wait for life after the pandemic, when we can enjoy the passion and intricacies that live music delivers.",

    "Artist Statement": "Meaningful relationships and connections are one of the things that make life fulfilling, however it can often be toxic to dwell on the past. We often put all our energy just to maintain a connection that can no longer exist on its own. It is important to know when to stop fighting for someone and let go with peace.",
