Separated by water, space, land, and connected via technology as illustrated by the phone notation. The red highlights the persons' locations on the map. I explore light and darkness to express emotional highs and lows; the dark tan-yellow background was used to capture illness and the pandemic with the lime green strokes for treatment, cure, and positive highlight.
