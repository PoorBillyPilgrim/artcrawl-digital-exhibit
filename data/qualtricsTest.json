    "Title of Artwork": "Negative < Positive < Duplicitous",
    "Artist Statement": "I, an engineering student at Georgia Institute of Technology, am prey to availability bias. As a computer science student, coding lectures had colonized a large part of my brain with JAVA codes. On a long-awaited Friday night, I watched James DeMonaco’s ‘The Purge’ (American Dystopian Screen-Play).  And here was I, on a Sunday morning, listening to the ‘American Life Podcast on Bad Apples’ for my next class. On a deep critical thought, these three weekend snapshots amalgamated in such a way that I created this multimodal artwork to represent the transformation of human nature in the 21st-century world where everyone has a hidden chameleon inside. All humanity awaits is anarchy.  What are we taught? What does ethics say? Positivity wins over negativity. Right? Now, imagine the purge day - NO LAW, NO POLICE, NO GOVERNMENT. Would you stay positive? Or turn negative like a chameleon?    Welcome to the transformation of human nature. Part 1: The Negative Purity, does it exist? No. Being from a science background, I understand how the real world is full of mixtures, made of pure substances, but end up being impure. Similar is the scenario with humanity. There is always a bad apple in a basket of many. We all have this one person, who stands out, in its literal meaning. Identical is the case when we see the larger picture. There is a ‘b’ in a group of majority ‘d’s. But, the question is, will the ‘d’s try to change ‘b’? Part 2: The Positive The answer is yes! The positivity always wins over the negativity. Eventually, ‘b’ in a group will realize the potential growth with a positive attitude in life; and will try to change. However, it’s also said, ‘once a cheater always a cheater’. The negativity can never disappear; it can just bind up and be powerless. That is exactly what happens. ‘b’ in a group will never lose its character; but it will gain new positive qualities to present a fusion of ‘b’ and  ‘d’ i.e. - ‘ b ’.  Now, does the transformation end? No!  Part 3: The Duplicitous Transformation never ends. 21st-century society has seen a surprising version of human nature. People have developed similarities with particles in chemistry - dual-natured. ‘The Purge’ - what does it show? The 21st-century world awaits for the lawless day when they get a chance to exhibit the hidden powerless trait of negativity they have. I believe Halloween is just the beginning. The world has much more to see as coins wait for an opportunity to flip.    Artistic Approach:  Colors:  The color scheme of the letters plays a significant role in depicting the amalgamation of traits in this artwork. Positivity is presented with green, as it is something appreciated and preferred. Negativity is present with red, as it is something seen as a warning and danger. However, the new combination of traits that the so-called ‘civilized’ society has is something neutralized, i.e. green + red = yellowish-orange.  Fractals: The pattern in the artwork is never-ending, same as humanity. The transformation never ends. It may repeat, evolve, or even reproduce; but it cannot stop, just like the fractals. Code and Genetics: The artwork shows the small elements of science. From a black background giving a coding feel to the bright color combination depicting genetics, this artwork completely shows how it presents a natural way of how humans are wired to transform.",

The brown shape underneath the train represents the shape of my home state in America - Maryland. I used tape while painting to separate the different colors in the background, giving a sense of rapidness to the train. The background also makes the artwork more abstract and geometric, consistent with the overall concept and shapes of the province/state. The artwork shows that, having already traveled from China to the USA, I am on a journey that only moves forward and continues, thereby linking and connecting the world in my own way.",
